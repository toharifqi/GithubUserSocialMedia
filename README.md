this is my final project from my holiday's week

I named this application My Github User.
Through this app, you can search any github users and view their basic profile. I used GitHub API that allows me to fetch github user's data (you can change the GitHub API token with your own by editing gradle.properties file). I store the datas on local database, SQLite. I also used content provider so other apps will be able to synchronize or fetch the data from this app

What you can do with this app?
- search any GitHub user and view their profile
- view someone's follower and who they are following to
- add someone as your favorite user
- delete someone from your favorite user list
- update favorite user list based on your action
- it has built-in widget to display your favorite users
